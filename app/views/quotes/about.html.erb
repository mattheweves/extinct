<h1>About Extinction</h1>

<p>
	<br />
	Extinction was built by <a target="_blank" href="http://gitub.com/mattheweves">Matthew Eves</a>.  This is the first Ruby on Rails web application
	I've ever built, and albeit incredibly simple, it is empowering to deploy your own app from the ground up.  May this be the beginning of an incredible
	journey.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
	I currently work as a Senior Application Consultant for a global time and attendance company, but on mission to get to the guts of how applications
	are developed and how pros work together to build software that changes the world.

    <p>
    I did a year of Computer Science in college, but switched because
		I thought I would get to build and create more with Mechanical Engineering than CS (not sure where I got my advice from when I was 18?).
		Either way, the desire hasn't left, in fact, it has grown stronger over the years and there's nothing I want to do more than learn, build,
		and contribute to software that empowers people.  Whether it saves them time, makes them money, or makes them smile, I'm all about it.
